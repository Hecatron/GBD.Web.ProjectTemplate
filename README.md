# Project Template Theme

## Overview

A jekyll based template that I use for all projects on github.
This modified theme can be viewed via 

 * https://grbd.github.io/GBD.ProjectTemplate/

Based on the original slate theme

 * https://github.com/jasoncostello/slate

## List of Changes

This is a bit basic at the moment but I plan on making a few different changes from the default Slate theme

 * The first change I've made is to make the pages dynamically generate from markdown files
 this way I can just add more markdown files and let a local copy of jekyll (or remote) output the site
